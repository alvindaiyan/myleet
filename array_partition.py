# You are given two non-empty linked lists representing two non-negative integers.
# The digits are stored in reverse order and each of their nodes contain a single digit.
# Add the two numbers and return it as a linked list.
#
# You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.
#
# Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)
# Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8
